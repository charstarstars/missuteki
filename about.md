title: What is missuteki?
permalink: about/

My friend explained how cool jazz music is because if you make a mistake, you can just repeat
the same mistake and then the mistake sounds intention. Two mistakes together is a mistake mistake
meaning it's not a mistake anymore! I thought this was brilliant and decided to apply the same
philosophy to my own creative endeavors. Thus, `missuteki` was born.

Missuteki has two additional meanings: It's a Engrish version of the word "mistake" making it a mistake spelling or pronunciation. Also
`mi` is the prefix for "three" in Japanese it can also mean look or see while
`suteki` is "beautiful" or "cool" in Japanese. Together it's tripley beautiful or looks cool.　三素敵!　見素敵!
