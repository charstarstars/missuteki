Ah, the Pacific Northwest, great for its expansive evergreen forests, snow-capped mountains, and rivers of chinook salmon. 
One of it's best, but less-referenced features, though, is its donut scene. From Voodoo and Blue Star in Portland to Top Pot and General Porpoise in Seattle, you can't go wrong. 

I hate to brag, but as it so happens I am a mighty good donut eater.

I go to Portland somewhat frequently, where Blue Star is a must-have.

Last week I was in Seattle for a wedding and stopped by General Porpoise for one of the best donut experiences I've ever had.
