Growing up with parents who were Taiwanese immigrants meant that I had to go to Chinese school.
Contrary to the belief of many of my regular American school classmates, Chinese school wasn't just
an immersion school. We didn't learn the same subjects as we did in regular school.
Chinese School was mostly about spending 3 hours on Saturday or Sunday (depending on 
which school you enrolled in) memorizing insanely complicated Chinese characters
that I would later forget. Learning Chinese characters was for the 1st and 2nd periods.

When I was younger, I did the calligraphic painting with horse-hair brushes. One of the basic painting
techniques we learned was how to draw bamboo. At the time I think I barely knew what bamboo was, let alone
what it looked like, so the instructions were a mystery to me.
