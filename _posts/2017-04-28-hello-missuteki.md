I've always been scared about making mistakes. I think a lot of us are, and with good reason! 
We've been burned by our slip-ups in social situations, typos in our cover letters, and showing
up at the wrong place at the wrong time. Yet, even though our mistakes cause embarrassment,
frustration, and self-loathing, mistakes can be good. Mistakes is how we make small changes to
grow in interesting directions. 

Maybe if we make more mistakes more often, we can learn and grow faster.

Missuteki was born out of the idea that the same mistake done multiple times doesn't show up
as a mistake anymore.  Missuteki is art done in triplicate. Let's see how many mistakes we can
make.
