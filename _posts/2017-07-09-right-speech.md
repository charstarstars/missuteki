One of the tenets of Buddhism is "Right Speech." Right speech is not only about being honest, but also not leaving anything out (deception) and not adding speech that is frivolous. Friends often come talk about their difficulties either as way to vent or as a genuine avenue to seek advice. I often have trouble knowing what the best things to say or do are. Do I merely listen intently? Do I commiserate in their problems? Do I jump in with my advice because I think they need an intervention? Do I tell them everything's going to be ok?  It's hard to know what words or actions will help people grow and find their own way the fastest, but I find that the easiest way to satisify "right speech" is to show gratitude from the heart.
