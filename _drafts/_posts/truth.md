I think all things—relationships, science, etc—all begin with the desire to find truth. That’s how I would hope to live my life. Truth is hard though. We are prone to believing the lies we tell ourselves in order to cope. You know all of this. I’m telling you because as someone who would like to live by truth, I am the most likely to distrust the narrative I tell myself and equally as likely to believe the narrative (because I can convince myself that it passes my harsh skepticism test). 

I feel the need to preface this because I know I’m fallible. I know I’m just human, but I expect so much more from myself. Maybe these expectations are unfounded or unhealthy, but to me they don’t seem like so much to ask even if it’s demanding. 

One thing I’m not doubtful of is that truth starts in observation. It’s one of many things that was really impactful on my life philosophy from the Vipassana retreat. I like the idea that if truth starts from observation and then you come up with analysis or interpretation of the observations that means that each step needs to hold truth. Observation, hypothesis, and validation all need to be purely truthful in order to arrive at Truth. Frequently, though, we forget about observation. The Vipassana retreat really made me keep coming back to the idea that in order to find truth, I need to start with observation and I need to practice truthful observation. Notice what you notice.
