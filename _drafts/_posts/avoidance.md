On the first few days of my \[10-day silent medition retreat\](https://www.dhamma.org), I dutifully followed the prescribed schedule of waking up at 4am, meditating in the meditation hall from 4:30-6:30am, taking breakfast at 6:30am, meditating from 8am-11am, lunch at 11am, meditating from 1pm-5pm, tea break at 5pm, meditating at 6pm, lecture at 7pm, then meditating 8:15-9pm and sleeping at 9:30pm.   
  
I would get so irritated though. I was trying my best to abide by the given instructions, but why was everyone around me so noisy? I thought this was a meditation retreat not one for shifting around in your seat cushion, walking up every 10 minutes, or coughing and scratching.  Every action was so crisply heard in the meditation hall, and I wanted so badly to ask if others were bothered by the constant interruptions in their concentration. Didnâ€™t the instructor say to try to be as still as possible? I thought I could handle it and just be able to focus on my own practice, but after 20 hours of meditation in 3 days, the abrupt noises chafing at my sanity finally wore me away. I would just get angry that I would keep getting interrupted.   
  
I finally decided to consult the assistant teacher.
