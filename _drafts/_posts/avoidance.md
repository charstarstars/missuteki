On the first few days of my [10-day silent meditation retreat](https://www.dhamma.org), I dutifully followed the prescribed schedule:

| --- | --- |
| 4:00 am | Morning wake-up bell |
| 4:30-6:30 am | Meditate in the hall or in your room |
| 6:30-8:00 am | Breakfast break |
| 8:00-9:00 am | Group meditation in the hall |
| 9:00-11:00 am | Meditate in the hall or in your room according to the teacher's instructions |
| 11:00-12:00 noon | Lunch break |
| 12noon-1:00 pm | Rest and interviews with the teacher |
| 1:00-2:30 pm | Meditate in the hall or in your room |
| 2:30-3:30 pm | Group meditation in the hall |
| 3:30-5:00 pm | Meditate in the hall or in your own room according to the teacher's instructions |
| 5:00-6:00 pm | Tea break |
| 6:00-7:00 pm | Group meditation in the hall |
| 7:00-8:15 pm | Discourse in the hall |
| 8:15-9:00 pm | Group meditation in the hall |
| 9:00-9:30 pm | Question time in the hall |
| 9:30 pm | Retire to your own room--Lights out |

  
Every time there was the option to meditate in my room, I meditated in the hall to force myself to do the work. 

I would get so irritated though. I was trying my best to abide by the given instructions, but how come everyone around me couldn't follow the instructions? Every five minutes someone would shift around in their seat cushion, or stand up and leave or cough or scratch.  Every action was so crisply heard in the meditation hall, and I wanted so badly to ask if others were bothered by the constant interruptions in their concentration. Didnâ€™t the instructor say to try to be as still as possible? I thought I could handle it and just be able to focus on my own practice, but after 20 hours of meditation in 3 days, the abrupt noises chafing at my sanity finally wore me away. I would just get pissed off that I would keep getting interrupted.   
  
I finally decided to consult the assistant teacher.  I told her I was having such a hard time concentrating on meditating when there were so many interruptions around me. She said something that I still think about a lot one year later:
