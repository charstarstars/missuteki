I make new year’s focuses as opposed to resolutions inspired by Alex Vermeer’s [8760 hours](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/). This year’s focus has roughly been about emotional intelligence, specifically:

1. Notice my emotional state
2. Notice the emotional state of others
3. In order to stop taking criticism personally, and
4. To develop loving kindness toward the people I interact with 

All of which seems to lead to the umbrella topic of “know thyself.” Too often I find myself (and others) falling into the trap of either procrastinating or developing repetitive thought loops that don’t serve me. I’ve found a great way to relieve procrastination, anxiety, and procrastination-induced anxiety is to ask myself: “what am I uncertain about?” Or “What feeling am I trying to avoid?” Sometimes it takes several cycles, but eventually I find what I’m avoiding and realize there are ways to address what I’m avoiding in a healthier way.
